## Benifits of EVs in Quebec

The Quebec government openly pushes for an increase of electric vehicles on the road and provides many incentives for the population to help them in reaching their goal of 100,000 EVs by 2020. Not only are carpool lanes open to those driving EVs on the highway, but those driving EVs are also exempt from paying tolls on the road. As of March 2016, 9,211 electric vehicles have been registered in Quebec. Ontario comes in behind with 6,506 and British Columbia next with 3,682. This begs the question, “Why are there so many more electric vehicles in Quebec?”

If you’re looking to purchase or lease a so-called “green car” in Quebec anytime soon, you will be eligible for a rebate from the government. While the largest rebate stands at $8000, it only applies to vehicles that are all-electric and plug-in hybrids with a big enough battery capacity. If electric motorcycles are more your fancy, the government is offering a $2000 rebate, though it has to be completely powered by electricity. The official list of eligible vehicles and the specific amount of rebate that is offered for each vehicle is available on the government’s website here.

Upon purchasing or even before purchasing your electric vehicle, installing a charging station may be something you should/want to think about as well. The government is offering a rebate of up to $600 for the purchase and installation of a new 240V EV charging station in your home. Further details on the government’s charging station rebate can be found here. Businesses and organizations are also eligible for financial assistance if they wish to install charging stations for their employees as well. Specific details can be found here.

Thinking of purchasing a Tesla? The city of Montreal is more than accommodating to owners of this EV. Montreal’s Tesla service and sales centre, located on Ferrier next to the famous Gibeau Orange Julep, is the largest in North America. Quebec also has 2 Tesla supercharger locations, one located in Montreal at the Ferrier store with 2 chargers and one in Drummondville with 8 chargers. If you’re worried that 2 supercharger locations isn’t enough, at Montreal’s Place Vertu parking lot, a new 12-stall supercharger station is already under construction. In addition, Tesla’s can plug in to any charging station, as the car comes with an adapter for this exact purpose and there are a multitude of charging stations in Quebec.
