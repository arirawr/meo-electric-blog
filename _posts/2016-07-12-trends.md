There are many trends that big-name car manufacturers are following, whether they specialise in electric cars or not. The fact that companies are even coming out with electric car models alongside gas-powered cars shows the rising popularity and demand for electric vehicles. As the number of electric vehicle manufacturers increases, we're seeing trends in innovation. From batteries to charging to style, here's what to expect from the next generation of electric vehicles:

## Re-Using Electric Car Batteries

Old electric car batteries are being repurposed to not only power homes, but other infrastructures such as data centres in [France](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/07/05/used-electric-car-batteries-to-power-data-center-in-france/?utm_content=buffera744e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) and the [United States](https://www.gm.com/mol/m-2015-jun-0616-volt-battery.html) as well. Although the used battery may not be fit to power the car it was beforehand, its storage capacity is still able to be used for other purposes. Car companies such as Chevrolet and Nissan have already been involved in this process with data centres, whereas BMW is soon to come out with a home-storage system using its i3’s batteries.

## Range and Style

As it stands, Tesla is undoubtedly the front-runner in performance and style when it comes to long-range electric cars. However, other prominent luxury car makers such as Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Aston Martin, and Faraday Future, are increasing competition between the brands with new models designed to have more kilometres per charge. It goes without saying that these luxury car brands will also try and out-do Tesla in style as well, proven by the fact that a [Porsche product manager claimed](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/166064/20160621/porsche-engineer-says-mission-e-will-be-something-special-while-exec-claims-teslas-ludicrous-mode-is-a-facade.htm) the Tesla Model S seats “suck.” The deciding factor in whether or not these companies will be real competitors with Tesla will most likely depend on the combination of their difference in price, range, and style.

## Electric Car Pricing

Electric Cars continue to get cheaper and thus more affordable for the majority of the population. The Tesla Model 3 prototype and the Nissan Leaf are both priced at around $35 000, though the Nissan Leaf is already available for purchase. Nevertheless, for a company like Tesla to make a long-range electric vehicle that’s affordable and pleasing to the eye, it shows a drive to open the EV market to the broader public, get more people driving EVs, and reduce emissions even further.

## Wireless Charging

Wireless charging could soon be done at home or even on the road with further research and development. Charging at home would involve installing a base pad that is either set on the floor of a garage, or even just beneath the ground, and a receiving pad below the vehicle. Companies such as WiTricity, Oak Ridge National Labs, and Qualcomm have all succeeded in testing their technologies and their wireless charging systems will soon be available to the public. Mercedes has also promised wireless charging by 2017 for the S500 e model. Additionally, an [EU funded project](http://horizon-magazine.eu/article/electric-roads-charge-your-car-you-drive_en.html), named “FABRIC,” is currently looking into the logistics of stationary EV charging whilst at tolls or stop lights as well as dynamic charging which would be done while driving on the road. If approved and standardized, wireless charging may soon be another go-to for EV drivers rather than just charging stations.

With further research and development, these four trends are sure to increase. Companies will compete with each other to come out with the most appealing and best-designed technologies for EV consumers and continue to convert gas-powered car owners to the electric car market.
