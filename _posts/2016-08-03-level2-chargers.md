Level 2 home chargers typically use a 240V outlet, which can be installed in homes for a couple of hundred dollars. These chargers usually fully charge an electric car in around 3-5 hours, if the household outlet is 240V. Different chargers vary in their amperages, or charging capabilities, so a 30A charger will charge slower than a 40A. Depending on the EV you own, the charging stations capabilities may not utilize all of the power that the station delivers; this is common in plug-in hybrid EVs.

## Level 2 Charger Cost
Level 2 charging stations come in a range of prices, depending on a number of different factors. Different amperage, cord length, design, country of production, and smart technology compatibility can all affect this range.

Depending on where you live, you may want to consider your government’s rebates for level 2 charging stations as well. Quebec offers up to $600 for purchase and installation, while Ontario offers up to $1,000.
