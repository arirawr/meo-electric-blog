Level 2 chargers are a must-have for EV owners -- the higher-powered chargers cut charging time from 8-12 hours to just 3-5 hours, depending on the car. Plus, many level 2 chargers now include "smart" capabilities, including mobile app monitoring, delayed charging, and charging that responds to your home energy usage.

Level 2 home chargers typically use a 240V outlet, which can be installed in homes for a couple hundred dollars. Different chargers vary in their amperages, or charging capabilities, so a 30A charger will charge slower than a 40A.

## Level 2 Charger Cost
Level 2 charging stations come in a range of prices, depending on a number of different factors. Different amperage, cord length, design, country of production, and smart technology compatibility can all affect this range. Most chargers on the market range from $500 to $1000, with increasing features.

Depending on where you live, you may want to consider your government’s rebates for level 2 charging stations as well. Quebec offers up to $600 for purchase and installation, while Ontario offers up to $1000.

## Level 2 Charger Installation

Unlike level 1 chargers, which can be plugged into a 120V household outlet, level 2 chargers require a 240V outlet (similar to those used by washing machines and dryers). Depending on your household's electrical layout, installation of your level 2 charger will cost between $1000 and $2000. Installations must be done by a professional electrician, due to the high voltages involved. When choosing an electrician, be sure that they are familiar with EV chargers and the process of installation.
